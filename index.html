				  	<h2>Travel</h2>
				  	<p>My first great passion is travel. Discovering new countries, cultures, landscapes and cult monuments is in my opinion the most wonderful and enriching thing. This provides experience and openness.

				  	<h2>Dance</h2>
				  	<p>My second passion is dance. After many years of practice, dance has become an escape for me. In my opinion, it also represents, an art expressed by the human body. And dance offers a space where you can free yourself, express yourself and let your emotions take control.

				  	<h2>Music</h2>
				  	<p>I am also passionate about music. Yes, we do not dance without music! It also allows you to escape and express yourself. Thus, just like dance, the music is very diverse, there are many genres. This leaves the choice to listeners who want to adapt the music to their emotions of the moment.

				  	<h2>Tennis</h2>
				  	<p>Finally, my last passion is tennis. The passion for tennis is not limited to the hours spent on the court. It is a constant quest for improvement, whether by working on his technique, strengthening his physical condition or studying opponents to find weaknesses to exploit.
